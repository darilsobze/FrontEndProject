# My Frontend Journey: Atomic Design of Skills

# #🖌️ Project overview

This project visualises my learning process in front-end development through an interactive and appealing design. The visualisation is based on an atomic model:

**_The core (Nucleus)_**: 

Represents my main learning sources.

**_The atoms_**:

Surround the nucleus and symbolise the skills I have acquired during my learning process.

**_The goal_**: 

Show my progress and visualise the connection between my learning sources and my skills.

🎯 _**_**_Objectives of the project_**_**_ 

Present my IT skills in a creative and visual format. To realise a flexible, modular system that applies the concepts of Atomic Design. To serve as inspiration for others who wish to document their learning journey.
